# 2D_Fisher-Stefan_Level-Set_Stability

This repository contains code and documentation for the preprint "Pattern formation and front stability for a moving-boundary model of biological invasion and recession", by Alexander K. Y. Tam and Matthew J. Simpson.

The repositort is organised as follows:
* Code: General open-source Julia code for the two-dimensional level-set method used to solve the Fisher-Stefan model.
* Documentation: Explains the numerical methods used in the level-set code.
* Results: Provides code and output used to generate Figure 4, Figures 5E-G, Figures 6E-G, and Figures 8F-K.

Code updated in June 2023 to fix a minor bug in the interface velocity calculation. We found no significant quantitative differences between results obtained with the updated version and the published results. Solutions contained in this repository are computed using the updated version.
